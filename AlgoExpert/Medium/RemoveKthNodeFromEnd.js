Remove Kth Node From End

Write a function that takes in the head of a Singly Linked List and an integer k (assume that the list has at least k nodes). The function should remove the kth node from the end of the list. Note that every node in the Singly Linked List has a "value" property storing its value as well as a "next" property pointing to the next node in the list or None (null) if it is the tail of the list.

Sample input: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9, 4
Sample output: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9
